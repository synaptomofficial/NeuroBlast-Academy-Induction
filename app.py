Thank you for your interest in implementing the **NeuroBlast Program**. NeuroBlast is a pioneering sports performance program that combines cutting-edge brain science with practical athletic training. The program is an initiative of **SynaptOm Pvt. Ltd.**, developed in close collaboration with our primary knowledge partner, the **Centre of Excellence in Neurodegeneration and Brain Health (CENABH)** at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT). It also incorporates international expertise through collaboration with Croatian experts.

This questionnaire is designed to help us understand your academy's unique structure and requirements. Your detailed responses are crucial for us to tailor the program effectively, ensure a smooth implementation, and prepare an accurate financial budget proposal.
